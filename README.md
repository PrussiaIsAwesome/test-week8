What do jQuery selectors start with?

$

What's the problem with this code
in your html:
<div class="my-element">Hide me</div>
in your javascript:
$(".another-element").hide();

$(".my-element").hide();

What's wrong with this code:
in your html:
<div class="my-element">Hide me</div>
in your javascript:
$("#hideMe").hide();

it is a class so it has to be .my-element

If you have a FOLDER named lib and a FILE named app.js, why won't this link to your javascript work?
<script src="app.js"></script>

It would have to also link to the folder so it would look like this <script src=”lib/app.js”></script>

What can you tell me about this: <input type="text"/> what is it? what will we be using them for?

it specifies where someone can enter something
